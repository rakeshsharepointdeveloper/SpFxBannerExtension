This extension will show up a message on the top of the modern page.
The message to show will be into a separate json file.
When the extension runs it will get the json file(the site url where the 'Site Assets/banner.json' file is uploaded is configured in the serve.json), extract the message and show up into the top placeholder of the modern site's landing page.
